# Predicting Fodd Sales by Outlet Type and Item Sales by Outlet


**Author**: Danielle Jones

### Business problem:

We want to increase sales across all outlets to reduce the inconsistent sales numbers that have been reported.


### Data:
I used a data set from Big Mart Sales found here https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/


## Results

### Here is what I found


#### Histogram

> Supermakets types 1 and 3 are the front runners and this is what we want to focus on when looking to increase the sales across all types.

#### Boxplot

## Recommendations:

It is my recommendation that the placement of the items in stores be the same throughout outlet type. Since we see that the sales do best in supermarkets that have the same item placements, #1 and 3.
