**Author**: Danielle Jones

### Business problem:

We want to increase sales across all outlets to reduce the inconsistent sales numbers that have been reported.


### Data:

> Supermakets types 1 and 3 are the front runners and this is what we want to focus on when looking to increase the sales across all types.

## Recommendations:

It is my recommendation that the placement of the items in stores be the same throughout outlet type and size. Since we see that the sales do best in supermarkets that have the same item placement throughout.
